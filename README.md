# image-recognition
In this group competition, participants collaborate to build machine learning models for image recognition using the MNIST Fashion database, which contains grayscale images of various apparel items. The objective is to predict each image's category label based on pixel brightness values, with the data condensed to 49 pixels (7x7) per image. The challenge entails finding optimal machine learning models, determining sample sizes for accurate predictions, and optimizing computational efficiency. Participants must construct 10 diverse classification models, including techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Evaluation is based on a scoring formula, considering training data proportion, algorithm runtime, and prediction accuracy. The competition promotes collaborative model development, sample size optimization, and computational efficiency while achieving precise predictions.
